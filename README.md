# Resume
Resume is a introductionn that tells briefly about a Person in a manner of Proffessionalism.
Once i had read a line- "what is essential in life ? It is invisible. "
here i mean to relate that resume is required for applying a job so that any unknown can know 
who are you? from where you are? what you know? what are your interests? and the main point is what are your technical skills? 
Now, 
If we are answering all the above questions in not a proper way or if they are answered in correct way that are required mean answers are not real which reflects you, then you will not face out all original happenings that will be happened in cooperate world. 

## My Resume is also somthing that reflects me and that will provide me the designation that I deserve that I can face out honestly. 
If you are checking out my resume then its my pleasure.
